# TIMELESS - Watch-Brand-App

TIMELESS is not only some e-commerce application, it is a journey.
Not only would you be capable of configuring your own watch, but search through a whole lot of collections of watches too and save them in your favourites!
This main reason for creating this project is to boost my design skills, improve the way my code is written and to test some new and exciting technologies.

## Technologies Used

For this application I have used React, Tailwind, Framer Motion and Figma (the design files are included)!
With the help of React Router Dom users would be able to easily navigate through the site and Framer Motion is used in order to make the transitions between pages better and more visually appealing.
